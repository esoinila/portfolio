								Here is 3D pointcloud that was calculated from distance matrices with Python
								Scikit-learn
								MDS algorithm. Here is a link to the
								<a
									href="https://medium.com/mlearning-ai/visualizing-3d-data-from-point-distance-information-with-mds-algorithm-in-python-e413c8d28631#e2e4-5ec3e29e34a4">
									article about the details.</a> The information of the point coordinates is recovered
								with linear algebra just
								from the distances between the points. This kind of methods can be useful for indoor
								navigation solutions, where
								the distances can be between sensors.

								Here is a play-view of Hummcar AppStore published game. The game is controlled by audio
								pitch only.
								Custom coded pitch-detection (generalized autocorrelation) algorithm moves the black
								needle.
								Hitting the green-trinagle accelerates
								and hitting the red triangle decelerates the car. Gears are changed by hitting the blue
								triangle.
								AI handles steering to stay on the track. The game was made with Unity3D game engine and
								graphics were made with Blender and Gimp.

								It was discovered that humming can be used to control accurately as an user-interface
								method
								even in quickly changing situations. This might be handy for handicapped people.

								Here is a photogrammetry video made from combination of drone-photographs and cell-phone
								photos.
								Meshroom software was used to produce 3D model that was imported to Blender for
								rendering.

								Drone footage was used to produce 3D model of Jokiuoma park in Vantaa Finland.
								The Meshroom produced 3D model was imported into Blender that was used to
								animate this camera movement. In essense a digital twin of the park ornament was
								produced with with photogrammetry.

								Here I am using my custom patented arc-melter to produce metallic glasses.
								Designing and constructing this apparatus formed a major part of my PhD thesis
								from Aalto University in 2013.

								I trained stable diffusion with my selfies, so I can produce artificial selfies.
								It took few hours to take enough pictures and prime the pre-trained model to
								know me from a specific word (ernoo) in the prompt. I used Google Colab for the
								training. Some of the selfies are so good people think they are real photos.

							<p class="video-p"> Below are some pictures of the device in various stages of use.
								Also images of the produced metallic glass. Inside the chamber Titanium is melted to
								purify
								the chamber before the Zr-based alloy is alloyed and cast. More details about the
								measurements and
								data analysis can be found in the <a href="Thesis.pdf">thesis</a>.</p>

								One of my my first commercial programming jobs was this musical edutainment game
								that used pitch detection for game control. The game was originally about neural network
								produced accompaniment notes. There were three orchestras with different musical
								instruments.

								Later we added three sub games. In abduction game the user ended up playing the
								melody track of the song, when playing well. Another of the sub games was one of the
								first singing games in the world. The game was published in Dezember 2000 as a CD-Rom
								in Finland with the name SoittoPeli. It was <a href="images/HS2001.pdf">reported</a>
								in Helsingin Sanomat newspaper in January 2001. Later the same singing game was
								separated
								into its own product and published in 2003 as STARAOKE in collaboration with Intervisio
								to produce the TV-format of the same name that much later ended up winning a technical
								Emmy award.
								All the employees were caricatured in the game, apparently I was the bear that gets
								really excited.
